Health and wellbeing plays a huge role nowadays in ensuring people are able to live a heathy and happy life. Not only the physical aspect, but the mental side of things aswell as mental health is ever more important in todays world. 
This motivated us to create a simple and easy to use app which allows younger and older adults to connect with one another. From being able to communicate between friends and family, to attending safe and organised events to try out new or familiar sports / social activities. The home page even hosts links to various articles that users read, to learn new skills and how to take care of yourself.
All the social elements of the app have been carefully thought of to provide a useful and practical app that allows adults of all ages to connect easily and safely. We also want the services and activities provided in the app to help support adults physical and mental wellbeing.
